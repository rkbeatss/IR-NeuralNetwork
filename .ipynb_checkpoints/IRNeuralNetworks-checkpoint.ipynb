    "\n",
    "With the growing trends of virtual assistants and chatbots, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a topic that is becoming increasingly popular in the recent years. From Google AI's Transformer-based models that consider a word's double-sided context to IBM's training data generator, today we have cutting edge approaches to solving NLP tasks.  However, even with these latest breakthroughs, NLP still faces many challenges, namely the problem of accurately deciphering what humans mean when they express something, regardless of how they express it. This problem falls under Natural Language Understanding (NLU), a subtopic of NLP that aims to increase the proficiency of intelligent systems in exhibiting real knowledge of natural language. Within this field, the task of paraphrase detection - determining whether a pair of sentences convey identical meaning - is considered to be an important one. Through the improvement of paraphrase detection, other NLP tasks that are integral to the efficiency of existing intelligent systems, such as question answering, information retrieval, and text summarization, can also be improved. For this reason, in this report, we propose to enhance the capability of neural networks in the context of paraphrase detection through the use of traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques as input features. \n"

Additionally, it will take a look at how the number of features and hidden layers improve the overall performance of the model.

    "Cosine Similarity is a simple IR measure that calculates similarity among pairwise input vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space, based on their cosine angle. In its core, this method is syntactic as it is purely based on common word occurrences/counts and does not take into account word order or other semantic information. However, it is more than enough to capture similarity for a baseline model. *explain why we chose this*. Let's do an example by hand with Quora dataset in order to illustrate this measure. \n",

    "Word Sense Disambiguation finds the best sense of a word from all the given senses of the word. The Lesk algorithm uses WordNet and gets the gloss of all the sense of the word in the sentence and then calculates the maximum overlap with the senses returning whichever gives the maximum overlap. For example, let's take the phrase 'pine cone'. 'Pine' has two senses. Sense 1: kind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves and Sense 2: waste away through sorrow or illness. 'Cone' has three senses. Sense 1: solid body which narrows to a point. Sense 2: something of this shape whether solid or hollow. Sense 3: fruit of a certain evergreen tree. Comparing the senses of the two words, we can see that 'evergreen tree' is common in one sense of each word. Therefore, Sense 1 of Pine and Sense 3 of Cone are the most appropriate when 'pine' and 'cone' are used together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this knowledge, we created our feature. After Lesk was applied to each sentences, where the most appropriate senses of each word was detected, we looked for the common senses in the two sentences. To normalize our result, we again used Jaccard. "
