    "\n",
    "With the growing trends of virtual assistants and chatbots, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a topic that is becoming increasingly popular in the recent years. From Google AI's Transformer-based models that consider a word's double-sided context to IBM's training data generator, today we have cutting edge approaches to solving NLP tasks.  However, even with these latest breakthroughs, NLP still faces many challenges, namely the problem of accurately deciphering what humans mean when they express something, regardless of how they express it. This problem falls under Natural Language Understanding (NLU), a subtopic of NLP that aims to increase the proficiency of intelligent systems in exhibiting real knowledge of natural language. Within this field, the task of paraphrase detection - determining whether a pair of sentences convey identical meaning - is considered to be an important one. Through the improvement of paraphrase detection, other NLP tasks that are integral to the efficiency of existing intelligent systems, such as question answering, information retrieval, and text summarization, can also be improved. For this reason, in this report, we propose to enhance the capability of neural networks in the context of paraphrase detection through the use of traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques as input features. \n",

    "The main objective of this report is to evaluate the performance of a neural network model given different IR features. Additionally, it will take a look at how the number of features and hidden layers improve the overall performance of the model. These results will be compared among two different training sets that have been annotated for paraphrase detection. Below is the proposed architecture for our particular neural network: \n",
